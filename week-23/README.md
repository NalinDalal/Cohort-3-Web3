## What weâ€™re building

a `Staking` contract where people can come and `stake` native ETH.

1. Initialise a foundry contract
```bash
forge init staking-contract
cd staking-contract

```
2. Add openzeplin to it
3. Add an alias/remapping for openzepilin
4. Try to write the OrcaCoin contract (it should extend ERC-20 from openzeplin)

5. Write test for it

6. Write staking contract
